# What is my opinion on important parts of code reviews.

In my opinion, Code reviews are important for both the reviewer, and the reviewee. The reviewee gets a second look at their code in case they reinvented the wheel, or some other detail was overlookd.
Code Reviews are also important for the reviewer, as they learn to look at the code in a different way.

# How containers can help us improve confusion dealing with different computers.

This is something I have come to stand strongly for in the past few weeks.
Before I was of the opinion that all computers should have the latest stable version of everything. As it turns out, I was greatly wrong in this regard.
Containers help us tremendously in the example that is referenced here, by ensuring that each one has the requirements to properly, run the application they contain every time without failure, they contain the application, the required libraries, and are handled in a way that the contained application runs properly every time.

I also have opinions on other use cases for containers.
